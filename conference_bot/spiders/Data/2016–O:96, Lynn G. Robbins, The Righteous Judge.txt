In His mortal life, Jesus Christ was a loving judge, uncommonly wise and patient. He is known in the scriptures as “the righteous judge”   and His counsel to us is to also “judge righteous judgment” (see  [in  footnote ]) and to “put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good … [and] to judge righteously” This counsel to the Nephite Twelve will help us judge as the Lord does: “Ye shall be judges of this people, which shall be just. Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am”  emphasis added). We sometimes forget that when He gave the counsel to be as He is, it was in the context of how to judge righteously.
