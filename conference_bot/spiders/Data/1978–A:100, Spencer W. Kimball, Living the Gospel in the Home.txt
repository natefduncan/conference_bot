Beloved brethren, I have thrilled and thrilled as I have heard the names of the new Regional Representatives called out, and as I realize that we have a great many more quality brethren in all places in the world. It makes us very happy indeed that the brethren are so responsive when offered an opportunity to serve the Lord in this capacity.
