First, a kind word for the little children. Yes, this is the last session, and yes, I am the final speaker.Recently, while visiting the Provo City Center Temple, I admired a painting entitled  The painting depicts the light and power from heaven as the Father and Son visited the young Joseph Smith.While not making a comparison with the very sacred event that ushered in the Restoration, I can imagine a similar visual that would reflect the light and spiritual power of God descending upon this general conference and, in turn, that power and light moving across the world.I give you my witness that Jesus is the Christ, that He guides the affairs of this sacred work, and that general conference is one of the very important times He gives direction to His Church and to us personally.During the Last Supper, the Savior gave a new commandment to His disciples, saying:“A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.“By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.”The Savior’s disciples were given a new commandment to do something more, something greater, and something more divine. This new commandment and invitation is summarized in the key phrase “as I have loved you.”
