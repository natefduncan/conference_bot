The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is continually growing and becoming better known throughout the world.

Some have images of clean-cut missionaries, loving families, and friendly neighbors who don’t smoke or drink. We might also be known as a people who attend church every Sunday for three hours, in a place where everyone is a brother or a sister, where the children sing songs about streams that talk, trees that produce popcorn, and children who want to become sunbeams.Brothers and sisters, of all the things  want to be known for, are there attributes above all others that should define us as members of His Church, even as disciples of Jesus Christ?

I invite you to listen both with ears that hear and with hearts that feel, and I pray for the Spirit of the Lord to be with all of us.
