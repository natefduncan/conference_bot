My heart sank during a recent meeting with wonderful Latter-day Saints. The question was asked, “Who desires to live with Heavenly Father again?” Every hand went up. The next question was “Who has confidence you’ll succeed?” Sadly and surprisingly, most hands went down.When we perceive a gap between who we are now and who we desire to become, many of us are tempted to choose to lose faith and hope.Because “no unclean thing can dwell with God,” in order to live with Him again we will need to be cleansed of sin and sanctified. If we had to do this  none of us would make it. But we are not alone. In fact, we are  alone.We have heaven’s help because of Jesus Christ and His Atonement. The Savior said, “If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me.” When faith is exercised, faith increases.Let’s consider together three principles that will help us on our journey back to our Father in Heaven.
